Drum Kit Web Application

This interactive web application allows users to play virtual drum sounds by clicking on drum images. Built with *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app maps each drum component (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.) to corresponding audio files. When a user clicks a drum image, an event listener triggers the associated sound using the **Web Audio API* or preloaded audio elements. The UI is designed with responsive layouts for seamless use across devices.  

Key Features:
- Event-driven sound playback (click/tap triggers audio)  
- Dynamic UI feedback (visual effects on interaction)  
- Optimized audio loading (preloaded or buffered sounds)  
- Responsive design (works on desktop & mobile)  

A fun, engaging way to explore basic front-end interactivity and DOM manipulation.
